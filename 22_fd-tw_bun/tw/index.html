			<p class="text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 mt-2 text-sm">
			We are here under one united purpose to kill all of the Duckies. These Duckies have had it too good for too long and now we will take them down. The tyranny of them to be at the forefront of all our projects and was even one of the most important questions on our final response. On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.

			<h3 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-5 text-base font-medium tracking-tight">Our 3 step master plan.</h3>
			<p class="text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 mt-2 text-sm">
			1) We need to gather a list of all Duckies that have been and will ever be. We need you to help us. Please contribute any names that you know that belong to duckies and their latest locations so we have data on their latest activity.
			<br>
			2) We shall track down their most frequent meeting spot and plant tracking devices to listen to their every move. Hopefully they will reveal their master plant and/or reveal a crucial weakness we can exploit. 
			<br>
			3) We shall gather a force to outnumber them 10 to 1 in order to destroy any hopes that they have of making a rebellion against our effort. We shall plan a day where we loot and kill everything that we know of.
