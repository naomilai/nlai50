1. set up app and wsgi entry point in same directory
	a. wsgi entry point -> connection between web serve and python
	b. connect (?) by calling from directory
2. ini -> long-term configuration for uwsgi
3. (systemd unit file) service -> manage system services
	a. within a weird looking directory? (/etc/systemd/system/myproject.servce)
4. make sure everything is in the same directory!
